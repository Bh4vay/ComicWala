# ComicWala - AI-Powered Comic Generation

## Overview
ComicWala is an innovative AI-driven platform that generates fully customized comics using cutting-edge generative AI technologies. It integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to craft engaging comic scripts from user-provided prompts and employs **Stable Diffusion** to transform those stories into visually stunning comic-style images. 

The platform is designed to provide an immersive experience where users can describe a story idea, and AI will generate a unique comic strip with AI-written dialogue and AI-generated illustrations. The system is hosted using **Gradio**, making it easily accessible for real-time interaction.
